# restIAF
Source code for `restIAF`, an automated resting-state individual alpha frequency (IAF) estimation routine implemented in EEGLAB. 
Repo also contains a manuscript (in preparation) outlining rationale for programme development and its performance on simulated and non-simulated datasets.

A preliminary implementation in Python for use with [MNE-Python](https://martinos.org/mne/) is available as part of the [`philistine` package](https://gitlab.com/palday/philistine).

Software developed in collaboration with Dr. Phillip Alday, Prof. Matthias Schlesewsky, & Prof. Ina Bornkessel-Schlesewsky, University of South Australia Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory.
